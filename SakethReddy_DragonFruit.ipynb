    "For the two types of images generated by the microscope and the dye sensor, the code employs different data structures for compact and efficient representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Microscope Image (Generated by the Microorganism):**\n",
    "   - **Data Structure Used:** Run Length Encoding (RLE)\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** RLE is chosen because microscope images often have large continuous regions of either background or microorganisms. RLE represents consecutive identical pixels with a count, which is very effective for such images. This compression technique reduces the storage space required.\n",
    "   - **Storage Estimate:** In the worst-case scenario, where the image has alternating values (010101...), each pixel would be represented as a sequence of (1, value). Assuming each pixel value (0/1) takes 1 byte and using 10 bits for counting, the worst-case size for one RLE pair is 10 bits + 8 bits = 18 bits (or 2.25 bytes). Therefore, the worst-case size for an `IMG_SIZE x IMG_SIZE` image is `IMG_SIZE * IMG_SIZE * 2.25 bytes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dye Sensor Image (Generated by the Dye Sensor):**\n",
    "   - **Data Structure Used:** Sparse Matrix Representation or Dictionary Encoding\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Dye sensor images often have mostly empty regions with sporadic occurrences of dye (1s). Using a sparse matrix representation or dictionary encoding, only the coordinates of non-zero values (where dye is present) are stored. This is efficient when there are only a few regions with positive values.\n",
    "   - **Storage Estimate:** For each `(x, y)` pair, we need to store two integer values. Assuming each integer is 4 bytes, the worst-case size for the entire image (where the entire image has dye cells) would be `2 * 4 bytes * IMG_SIZE * IMG_SIZE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data structures are chosen to optimize storage for the specific characteristics of microscope and dye sensor images, providing efficient representation while minimizing storage space."

By creating synthetic images with known cancerous regions, it allows evaluating the accuracy of the code in identifying cancer cells.

LZW is a dictionary-based compression algorithm that works well for images with repetitive patterns, as it can identify and replace repeated sequences with shorter codes. The impact on runtime would depend on the nature of the image. For images with substantial redundancy, LZW could achieve good compression ratios, potentially reducing storage requirements. However, the runtime impact might be noticeable, as the compression process involves dictionary lookups and code assignments.\n",
